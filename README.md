## Never Alone (Kisima Ingitchuna) ultrawide and wider fix
![](preview.jpg)

The small [patcher](/../../releases) removes the side black bars (pillarboxing) from the game at 21:9 and wider aspect ratios.

It does not address the native issue of the Cultural Insights FMVs being cropped. As a workaround, the videos can be watched properly at any time from the menu by switching to a 16:9 resolution in the game, or on YouTube.

Tested on the latest Epic Games Store version at 2560x1080 and 5760x1080. Steam patcher tested by czarman of WSGF.
